4. Representing the marginal probability like - what percent of customers have purchased KP281, KP481, or KP781 in a table (can use pandas. crosstab here)
5. Check the correlation among different factors using heat maps or pair plots.
6. With all the above steps you can answer questions like: What is the probability of a male customer buying a KP781 treadmill?
